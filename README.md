# Data Visualization for Intro to Encryption

This project was created to demonstrate key encryption concepts and data visualization techniques during a lecture on **Introduction to Encryption**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to show how encrypted and unencrypted data can be visualized, interpreted, and analyzed. It includes practical examples of:

- Plaintext vs. ciphertext  
- Basic encryption and decryption processes  
- Time measurement for brute-force attacks  
- Visualization of encryption patterns and data transformation  

## Features

- Implementations of classic encryption algorithms  
- Decryption demonstrations  
- Brute-force attack simulation with timing analysis  
- Visual comparisons of data before and after encryption  

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes and is well-suited for:

- Cryptography introductions  
- Demonstrations  
- Self-study and experimentation with basic encryption concepts
